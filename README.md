# ETL Pipeline Using Object-Oriented Programming
This repository contains Python code for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline implemented using object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you'll need:

Python 3.8 or later
pandas library
numpy library
Files
ETL using OOP.py: This is the main file that contains the code for the ETL pipeline. The pipeline extracts data from a source file, transforms the data by cleaning and transforming it as necessary, and loads the transformed data into a destination file.
loan.csv: This is a sample source data file.
output.csv: This is the destination file where the transformed data is loaded.
